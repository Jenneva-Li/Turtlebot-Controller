## Introduction[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#introduction)


The TurtleBot3 controller enables users to operate the TurtleBot3 using keyboard controls, providing an intuitive interface for navigation. The controls are as follows: pressing W moves the robot forward, D turns it to the right, A turns it to the left, S moves it backward, and X stops the robot.

In addition to these basic movements, the controller incorporates odometry feedback, allowing users to receive real-time updates on the robot's position and orientation. This feedback enhances the user experience by providing valuable information for more precise control and navigation, making it easier to manage the TurtleBot3 in various environments.

## Design[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#design)

This project was inspired by the turtlebot_teleop package, which allow easy navigation and manipulation of the robot in various environments using keyboard controls. Motivated by its functionality, I decided to create my own version of keyboard control, incorporating odometry feedback to enhance the overall user experience and to provide real-time updates on the robot's position and orientation, allowing for more precise control and navigation. This project not only reinforced my understanding of ROS and robotics but also encouraged me to experiment and innovate within the framework.
